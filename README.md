# Industrial Component Monitoring (Server source code)

## Introduction

A complete explanation of what [ICM](https://skytoptechnologies.com/consultancy/industrial-condition-monitoring "ICM") really is. This is a technical overview of the technology stack in use.

## Technologies

This project relies on the following technologies to function:

* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/javascript/ "Plotly")
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/ "Bootstrap") 
* [Flask](flask.pocoo.org/ "Flask")
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/ "Heroku")

## Decsription

The server architecture is built using [Flask](flask.pocoo.org/ "Flask"). It receives requests (data) from the monitoring client through POST requests sent to the */api* endpoint. The requests are _JSON_ objects sent by the client every other second. As of now the data being sent is coordinates in the form *{x: 3, y: 4, z: 4}*.
These values represent displacement figures being generated by the client.

Once the server receives the request, it parses the _JSON_ object into a Python list.
